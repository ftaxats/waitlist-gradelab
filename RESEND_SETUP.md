# Resend Email Setup for GradeLab

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Resend email functionality has been implemented in your API route. Here's what you need to do to complete the setup:

## 1. Install Resend Package

```

## 2. Get Resend API Key

1. **Sign up** at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. **Create a new API key** in your dashboard
3. **Copy the API key** (starts with `re_`)

## 3. Add Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Supabase Configuration (you already have these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here

# Resend Email Service (NEW)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

For production, verify your domain in Resend:
1. Go to Resend dashboard → Domains
